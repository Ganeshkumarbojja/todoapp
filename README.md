# Todo App

Todo App with a twist.

- We can specify the quantity for a task by adding a number after the task name.
- This number indicates how many times the task should be added to the list.
  For instance, "Write code 3" means the task "Write code" will be added to the list three times.
- And Each time we update a task, it will be saved to a counter and shows as "Write code (Updated 2 times)"
